You can use this in windows computer, and self define the short cut key.
First time I make this application is that the short-cut key in windows is soooo less. I want to self-define the short cut such as Alt/Win/Shift/Win + 0~9/a~z so that i can open file/folder more quickly.
and currently it has function that:
1. open file/folder by short-cut key
2. open application by short cut key
3. automatic run this application after reboot computer
4. save the configuration file to xml
5. copy pre-define string to clip board
6. show the application anywhere any time by press Win+~
7. hide the application by press Esc
