You can use this in windows computer, and self define the short cut key.
First time i make this application is that the shortcut key in windows is soooo less. I want to self-define the short cut such as 
            Alt/Win/Shift/Win + 0~9/a~z
            so that i can open file/folder more quickly.
            and currently it has function that:
            1. open file/folder by shortcut key
            2. open application by short cut key
            3. automatic run this application after reboot computer
            4. save the configration file to xml
            5. copy pre-define string to clip board
            6. show the application anywhere anytime by press Win+~
            7. hide the application by press Esc
